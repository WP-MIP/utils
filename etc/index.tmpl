    <center><h1>The WP-MIP Forecast Portal</h1></center>
    <br>
    <p>The Weather Prediction Model Intercomparison Project (WP-MIP) aims to identify the strengths and weaknesses of AI, hybrid and physical numerical weather prediction models.  The <a href="https://www.wcrp-esmo.org/activities/wp-mip">WP-MIP website</a> provides background about the project and links to all associated resources.</p>

    <p>This is the landing pad for the WP-MIP forecast archive, hosted by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC).  The data stored in this archive has been submitted by contributing institutions following WP-MIP protocols.  The core protocol requires that contributors provide 10-day global deterministic forecasts on a common 0.25-deg global grid.  Forecasts are initialized every three days throughout 2024, beginning with 0000 UCT 1 January 2024.</p>

    <p>Contributions to WP-MIP appear in two streams.  The Own Initial Conditions (OIC) stream consists of forecasts initialized using the datasets generated by the
      contributing centre.  For national meteorological services, this usually means their own analyses; however, some institutes use analyses from other centres if
      they do not genreate their own.  The Same Initial Conditions (SIC) stream consists of forecasts initialized from operational European Centre for Medium-Range
      Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses.</p>

    <h3>Retrieving WP-MIP Forecasts</h3>
    <p>For a quick interactive look at available WP-MIP data, you can use the links within the tables below to investigate the archive.  Alternatively, you
      can <a href="WP-MIP">browse the archive</a> using your web browser.  These methods are also useful if you want to download a small number of files through your browser.</p>

    <p>To download larger volumes of data, use the wget application.  Download instructions for specific variables are provided through the links in the table below.
      These intructions are relatively general for users already familiar with the archive structure.  For example, to retrieve all 500 hPa geopotential height
      forecasts from the IFS integrations submitted by ECMWF:
      <pre>
	wget -e robots=off -nd -r --no-parent -A "*_500*.grib2" http://hpfx.collab.science.gc.ca/~swpm001/WP-MIP/forecasts/oic/ecmf/pm_00/gh/
      </pre>
      The wildcards in the file name and path should be modified to target the data to retrieve.  If any of this is unclear, use the links in the tables below
      to find the data that you need, then follow the specific download instructions provided.</p>

    <h3>Current Archive Status</h3>
    <p>The version numbers for each of the contributions is shown in the tables below to indicate data availability.  These archive tables were last updated at GEN_DATETIME.</p>
