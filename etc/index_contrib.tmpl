    <center><h1>WP-MIP Forecast and Analysis Contributions</h1></center>
    <br>

    <p>This data access point of the <a href="https://hpfx.collab.science.gc.ca/~swpm001">WP-MIP Forecast Portal</a> is structured around the contributions from participating institutions.  This is the most straightforward way to find all of the forecasts generated by a specific group, and to get an overview of the data that are available in the archive.  If you are trying to find all available the forecasts for a specific forecast field within the archive (e.g. 850 hPa temperatures), use of the <a href="index_byvar.html">Forecast Field Entry Point</a> is recommended.
    
    <p>Contributions to WP-MIP appear in two streams.  The Own Initial Conditions (OIC) stream consists of forecasts initialized using the datasets generated by the
      contributing centre.  For national meteorological services, this usually means their own analyses; however, some institutes use analyses from other centres if
      they do not genreate their own.  The Same Initial Conditions (SIC) stream consists of forecasts initialized from operational European Centre for Medium-Range
      Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses.</p>

    <h3>Current Archive Status</h3>
    <p>The version numbers for each of the contributions is shown in the tables below to indicate data availability.  These archive tables were last updated at GEN_DATETIME.</p>
